# Your tasks ...
#
# Create a Person class in lib/Person.pm
#
# A Person has the following attributes:
#
# * first_name - read-write
# * last_name - read-write
#
# This class should also have a method named "full_name". This
# method should return the first and last name separated by a space
# ("Jon Smith").
#
# Write a BUILDARGS method for this class which allows the caller to
# pass a two element array reference. These should be assigned to the
# first and last name respectively.
#
#   Person->new( [ 'Lisa', 'Smith' ] );
#
# Hint: A quick and dirty way to check for this is to use ref() to check if
# the first value in @_ is an array reference (perldoc -f ref). A nicer way to
# do this might be to use Scalar::Util::reftype().
#
# Create an Employee class in lib/Employee.pm
#
# The Employee class is a subclass of Person
#
# An Employee has the following attributes:
#
# * title - read-write
# * salary - read-write
# * ssn - read-only
#
# The Employee class should override the "full_name" method to append the
# employee's title in parentheses ("Jon Smith (Programmer)"). You can assume
# that the title is always set. Use override() and super() for this.
#
# Finally, both classes should be free of Moose droppings and should be
# immutable.
