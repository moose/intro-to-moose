= Intro (30 minutes)

* concepts (ala Moose::Manual::Concepts)

= Classes

* Making a class use Moose
* extends
* overrides/super
* trivial attributes
** has 'foo' => ( is => ... ) (ro & rw)
** no other attribute features yet
* "no Moose"
* Immutability

== Exercises

* Build a Person class that uses Moose
** first_name
** last_name
** assume both attributes are always provided
* build an Employee class that is a subclass of Person
** job_title

= Roles

* Making a role
* roles as interfaces
* requires
* consuming roles in classes
* consuming roles in roles
* "no Moose::Role"

== Exercises

* build a role for Human
* make the Person class consume the role
* make the role require a "full_name" method
* implement this method for Person
* override it for Employee to include their title

= Basic attributes

* required
* default & builder
* lazy
* predicate, clearer
* init_arg
* reader & writer
* attribute inheritance
* MX attribute naming modules

== Exercises

* Go back to Person class
** make first & last name required
* Go back to Employee
** make title default to "Worker"
** add predicate & clearer for title
** add salary_level attribute, number from 1-10
** salary, lazy default of salary_level * 1,000, init_arg is undef

= Method modifiers

* before/after
** before for state validation
** after for additional state changes
* around
** modifying arguments & return values
* method modifiers in roles
** requiring the wrapped method
* augment/inner

== Exercises

= Types

* built-in types
* parameterizable types
* declaring subtypes
** URI
** Email
** class names & role names
* coercions
* duck_type
* attribute isa & does
* attribute coerce => 1
* MX::Types

== Exercises

* Add sane types to all existing attributes in Person, Employee, roles
* Add an email attribute. Make a new email type that does some minimal validate like /[^@]+\@[\w\-]+(?:\.[\w\-]+)+/

= Advanced attributes

* weak_ref
* triggers
* delegation
* metaclass & traits

== Exercises

* Make the bank account a proper object and delegate to it for deposit & withdraw
* Add an overdraft account like in the cookbook
* Make the overdraft account link bank to accounts which link to it as a weak_ref
* metaclass & traits?

= Introspection

* List of attributes for a class
** attribute options
** associated methods
* List of methods for a class
** associated attributes
** check original_package for source of method (did it come from a role?)
** $method->isa(...) to determine if it's wrapped/augmented/overridden
* List of parent classes, subclasses

= Tour of MooseX

* MX::AH
** delegation for Perl built-ins
** private accessor with public provides (_options as the attribute, get_option, set_option, options_list)
** lazy default of an empty reference
* ::StrictConstructor
* ::Getopt
* ::Clone
* ::Declare
* ::Workers
* ::Singleton
* ::ClassAttribute

= Writing a MooseX Module
